## Used Tools  
- **Burp Suite** – For interception, request manipulation, and vulnerability testing.  
- **Gobuster** – Directory and file brute forcing.  
- **FFUF** – Flexible web fuzzing to discover hidden endpoints.  
## Techniques  

### Directory Traversal & Content Discovery  
One of the key steps during reconnaissance was enumerating directories and hidden endpoints. The tool **ffuf** was used to brute force paths against the target application.  

Command:  
``
```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/portfolio/juice_shop]
└─$ ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://localhost:3000/FUZZ -fs 80117
```

Example Output:  
```  
        /'___\  /'___\           /'___\       
       /\ \__/ /\ \__/  __  __  /\ \__/       
       \ \ ,__\\ \ ,__\/\ \/\ \ \ \ ,__\      
        \ \ \_/ \ \ \_/\ \ \_\ \ \ \ \_/      
         \ \_\   \ \_\  \ \____/  \ \_\       
          \/_/    \/_/   \/___/    \/_/

```

This revealed several interesting endpoints such as `/ftp`, `/profile`, and `/administration`, which later led to findings including **sensitive data exposure** and **weak access controls**.  

### Manual Reconnaissance with Burp Suite  
Burp Suite was used extensively to:  
- Intercept and analyze HTTP requests and responses.  
- Modify and replay requests to test for authentication flaws and authorization bypass.  
- Inspect JWT tokens and cookies.  
- Identify weak or missing security headers.  
- Test input fields for SQLi, XSS, and parameter tampering.  

This combination of **automated fuzzing** and **manual testing** ensured wide coverage of potential attack vectors and enabled deeper exploitation of the discovered vulnerabilities.
