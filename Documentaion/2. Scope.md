## 1. Target Environment

- **Application**: OWASP Juice Shop (latest stable version)
- **Hosting**: Docker container running locally on a private lab machine
- **Access Point**: http://localhost:3000
- **Infrastructure**: Isolated lab environment with no internet exposure

## 2. Testing Type

- **Approach**: Black-box penetration test
- **Knowledge Level**: No access to source code, logs, or system internals
- **Restrictions**: No use of public write-ups, tutorials, or challenge solutions related to OWASP Juice Shop

## 3. Allowed Activities

- Manual and automated testing of web application input vectors
- Use of tools such as Burp Suite, browser developer tools, curl, Nmap, and others
- Interception and manipulation of HTTP requests
- Use of standard penetration testing techniques (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS, brute force)
- Authentication and session handling tests using own test account(s)

## 4. Testing Constraints

- **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks**: Strictly prohibited
- **Privilege Escalation Outside App Scope**: Not allowed (e.g., escaping container)
- **Social Engineering**: Not applicable
- **Persistence or Malware Deployment**: Not applicable
- **External Target Interaction**: Only the Juice Shop container is in-scope
- **Time constraint**: 20 hours for the penetration testing

## 5. Risk Categories Tested

The focus of this assessment is to identify and exploit vulnerabilities corresponding to the **OWASP Top 10 â€“ 2021**:

- [[A01 - Broken Access Control  ]]
- [[A02 - Cryptographic Failures]]  
- [[A03 - Injection  ]]
- [[A04 - Insecure Design]]
- [[A05 - Security Misconfiguration]]
- [[A06 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components]]
- [[A07 - Identification and Authentication Failures]]  
- [[A08 - Software and Data Integrity Failures]]  
- [[A09 - Security Logging and Monitoring Failures]]  
- [[A10 - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF]])

*Note: If a category is not represented in the application, it will be documented as "Not Applicable".*

## 6. Legal and Ethical Considerations

- All testing is conducted in a **legally authorized**, **self-hosted**, and **isolated environment**
- No real users, production systems, or third-party services are affected
- The purpose of this assessment is strictly educational and demonstrative for portfolio use
