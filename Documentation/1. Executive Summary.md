This penetration test was conducted on the OWASP Juice Shop web application in a controlled environment, simulating a black-box attacker with no prior knowledge of the internal source code. The objective was to evaluate the application’s security posture against the OWASP Top 10 – 2021 risk categories.

## Scope
- Target: OWASP Juice Shop (Docker-hosted, local environment)
- Testing Type: Black-box, no access to source code or walkthroughs/write-ups
- Focus: Identification of vulnerabilities related to OWASP Top 10 (2021)

## Key Findings
The assessment revealed 24 vulnerabilities, ranging from low-severity misconfigurations to high-severity flaws enabling account takeover and potential remote code execution.

### Critical Findings
- SQL Injection in product search and login forms allowed extraction of database content, including usernames, emails, and password hashes.
- Weak Cryptography (MD5 password hashing) enabled cracking of administrative credentials.
- Broken Access Control (IDOR) allowed attackers to view other users’ baskets, post comments as other users, and make purchases with other users’ payment methods.
- Insecure File Upload could be abused to upload disguised malicious files, potentially leading to remote code execution.

### High/Medium Findings
- Predictable IDs and negative cart manipulation highlighted insecure design flaws.
- Weak authentication mechanisms, including a permissive password policy, brute-forceable login, and persistent JWT tokens after logout.
- Misconfigurations such as overly permissive CORS headers, lack of Content Security Policy (CSP) on most endpoints, exposed robots.txt, and publicly accessible FTP services leaking sensitive files.
- The email addresses of users who leave reviews or comments on products are leaked.  
### Low Findings
- Information disclosure through predictable error messages and minimal security logging.
- Discovery of hidden administrative pages and sensitive backup files.
- User's emails are leaked in the product reviews.

## Overall Risk Assessment
The overall security posture of the application is highly vulnerable, with multiple exploitable critical flaws that could allow an attacker to:

- Gain unauthorized access to sensitive user data (including credentials).
- Escalate privileges to administrative accounts.
- Execute arbitrary code or perform destructive actions on the server.
- Abuse weak configurations and insecure design to persist access and remain undetected.

## Recommendations (High-Level)
- Prioritize remediation of critical vulnerabilities (SQLi, MD5 password hashing, file upload, IDORs).
- Strengthen authentication mechanisms (strong password policy, account lockout, invalidate tokens after logout, enforce MFA).
- Harden configuration and design (restrict CORS, apply strict CSP globally, sanitize file uploads, restrict FTP access).
- Improve monitoring and logging to detect malicious activity in real time.
