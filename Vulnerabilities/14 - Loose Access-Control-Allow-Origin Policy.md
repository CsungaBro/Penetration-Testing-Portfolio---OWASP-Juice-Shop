## Finding  
The application’s HTTP response headers include:  

```http
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

This allows **any origin** to make cross-origin requests to the API. While the response does **not** include:  

```http
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```  

— which means cookies, tokens, or authentication headers are not automatically exposed — the current configuration still **broadens the attack surface**. If the server is later misconfigured to allow credentials, or sensitive data is exposed in non-authenticated endpoints, this could be exploited via **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) abuse**.  

---
## Impact  
- **Data Exposure Risk:** Any domain can embed or script API calls, which may facilitate attacks such as phishing or malicious integrations.  
- **Future Exploit Potential:** If CORS with credentials is enabled later without restriction, it can lead to **full account takeover via CSRF-like attacks**.  
- **Weaker Security Posture:** The current setup violates the principle of least privilege for cross-origin access.  

**Severity:** Medium

## Recommendations  
1. **Restrict Origins:**  
   - Replace `*` with a whitelist of trusted domains (e.g., `https://yourapp.com`).  
2. **Separate Public vs Private APIs:**  
   - If certain APIs must be publicly accessible, isolate them from sensitive, authenticated APIs.  
3. **Avoid Wildcard with Credentials:**  
   - Never combine `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` with `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`.  
4. **Security Review:**  
   - Periodically review CORS policies to ensure changes do not inadvertently expose sensitive endpoints.
